This project focuses on predicting the survival of breast cancer patients using machine learning algorithms.
It includes data visualization techniques to understand the dataset better, showcasing distributions of features, correlations between variables, and survival rates.
Various algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) were applied to predict patient survival.
The repository includes steps to clone the project, install required packages, and run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts for training and evaluation.
The main contributor to this project is Fardin Kaisar.
